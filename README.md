## 🛡️ The Prompt Moat

STRATOS uses a proprietary "Anti-Slop Protocol" to ensure content sounds human:

- **Banned AI Clichés**: Over 50 words like "delve," "tapestry," "game-changer" are auto-rejected
- **Entity Density Rules**: Forces specific data (names, dates, percentages) over vague adjectives
- **Burstiness**: Varies sentence length to mimic human rhythm
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Uses First Principles, Inversion, and Pareto Analysis thinking models
