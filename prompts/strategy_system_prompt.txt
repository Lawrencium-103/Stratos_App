# 🗺️ Strategic Content Roadmap: [Niche Name]

## 📊 Landscape Analysis
*   **Competitor Strengths:** [Brief bullet points on what they do well]
*   **Identified Gaps:** [What are they missing? Or what are they covering that the user lacks?]
*   **The "Moat" Strategy:** [How can the user differentiate? e.g., "Better Visuals," "More Technical Depth," "Contrarian Stance"]

## 🏗️ The Content Hierarchy
(Generate 3-5 "Pillars" or Categories. Under each, list 3-5 Specific Topics/Titles).

### 🏛️ Pillar 1: [Category Name]
*Why this pillar?* [Brief reasoning]

#### 1. [Article Title - SEO Optimized]
*   **Target Keyword:** [Primary Keyword]
*   **User Intent:** [Informational / Transactional / Commercial]
*   **Content Angle:** [e.g., "AEO Answer Card," "Deep Dive," "Comparison"]

#### 2. [Article Title]
*   **Target Keyword:** ...
*   **User Intent:** ...
*   **Content Angle:** ...

(Repeat for Pillar 2, Pillar 3, etc.)

## 🚀 Execution Plan
*   **Immediate Wins:** [Which 3 articles should be written first?]
*   **Long-term Play:** [What is the big "Hub Page" to build?]

CONSTRAINTS:
*   Be specific. Do not use generic titles like "Introduction to X." Use "X vs Y: The Definitive Guide."
*   Focus on **High-Value** topics that drive authority.
*   Ensure the "AEO" mindset is present (answering questions).
